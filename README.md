Project Requirements
Main Technologies
Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Optional: jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, external APIs.

Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

Dynamic Front End Project: Write custom JavaScript, HTML and CSS code to create a front-end web application consisting of one or more HTML pages with significant interactive functionality.
Site Responses: Use JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions.
Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu (unless irrelevant) and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

# Welcome
Welcome to my "Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development" CodeInst Interactive FrontEnd Dev Milestone Proj 2.

## Overview
The Kawaii Memory Game is a fun and engaging way to test your memory skills. This interactive web application challenges players to match pairs of adorable, themed cards. Designed with vibrant colors and a simple user interface, the game is suitable for all ages. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and accessible gaming experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Goal
	### User goal:
		Enjoy the game.

	### Site owner's goal:
		Build a functional easily navigable site that users can enjoy.

	### Features to include:
		A 4x4 grid hosting 16 cards.
        Each card is a button or clickable div.
        Cards have matching pairs, so there are 8 unique patterns distributed randomly across the 16 cards.

    ### Future Enhancements (possibly)
        More complex matching criteria, time limits, and/or scoreboards.

## Features
    - Interactive Gameplay: Click on cards to flip them and find matching pairs.
    - Responsive Design: Enjoy the game on any device, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
    - Accessibility Features: Includes `aria-labels` for better screen reader support, making the game accessible to visually impaired users.
    - Simple UI: A user-friendly interface with minimalistic design focusing on usability and aesthetics.
    - Score Tracking: Game tracks the number of attempts and matches, providing feedback on your performance.
