---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Requirements
Main Technologies
Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Optional: jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, external APIs.

Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

Dynamic Front End Project: Write custom JavaScript, HTML and CSS code to create a front-end web application consisting of one or more HTML pages with significant interactive functionality.
Site Responses: Use JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions.
Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu (unless irrelevant) and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

# Welcome
Welcome to my "Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development" CodeInst Interactive FrontEnd Dev Milestone Proj 2.

# Goal
	# User goal:
		Enjoy the game.

	# Site owner's goal:
		Build a functional easily navigable site that users can enjoy.

	# Features to include:
		A 4x4 grid hosting 16 cards.
        Each card is a button or clickable div.
        Cards have matching pairs, so there are 8 unique patterns distributed randomly across the 16 cards.

    # Future Enhancements (possibly)
        More complex matching criteria, time limits, and/or scoreboards.

# Features
    # Instructions: Clearly explain how to play the game at the start or on a separate instructions page.
    # Feedback: Provide immediate visual and/or auditory feedback for actions (e.g., revealing a card, finding a match).
    # Progress Tracking: Keep the player informed about their progress, such as the number of matches found and attempts made.

# Content
	This includes history and information.

# Software installed and used
- 	VS Code
		- Live Preview Extension
		- GitHub Pull Requests and Issues Extension
- 	Github Desktop
- 	git 
- 	Balsamiq Wireframes (possibly)
- 	Notepad++
	
# Wireframes
    Game Title: Placed at the top center of the page.

# FAQ
-	A 4x4 grid hosting 16 cards.
-   Each card is a button or clickable div.
-   Cards have matching pairs, so there are 8 unique patterns distributed randomly across the 16 cards.
-   Players click on a card to reveal its pattern.
-   Players must then select another card, attempting to find its match.
-   If the cards match, they remain revealed. If not, both cards are hidden again after a short pause.
-   The game tracks the number of attempts and matches.
-   The game ends when all pairs are matched.
